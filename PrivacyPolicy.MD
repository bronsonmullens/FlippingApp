Personal information is not collected, used, or stored from the use of this application. All information and settings stored within the app are non-personal and only stored on your local device. This app only stores text - it will never ask for access of your camera or photo library.

The information that is stored within the app consists of the names of items, the price paid, the price it is selling for, and the quantity held. That's it. I don't need your email, name, or a photo of your cat (I'm sure your cat is adorable).
