# Just Flip It!
### By Bronson Mullens

## A profit log and inventory management tool for resellers. Written in Swift. 100% free.

### What?
This app allows users to log items that they have purchased and include what they'd like to sell it for. This builds up an inventory value. When an item sells, a user can report the sale and profit will be automatically calculated and added to the profit tracker.

### Why?
My wife and I have recently started going to garage sales. We wanted a tool that would accomplish what this app does, but without the bloat of a large spreadsheet or aggresive in-app purchase models.

### Feature overview:
* Track profits
* Log inventory
* Specify quantity for items

### Feature wishlist:
* Additional filters such as stale items, hot items, etc.
* Cloud backups
* Change color of UI
